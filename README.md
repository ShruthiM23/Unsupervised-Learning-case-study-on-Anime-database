# Unsupervised-Learning-case-study-on-Anime-database

# Problem Statement:
A study on unsupervised learning techniques(Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction), market basket analysis and recommendation systems on 'Anime Database'.

# Brief background about "Anime":
"Anime" is a Japanese animation art form which has different genres used to refer to all animated works, regardless of style or origin.

Here, in this case study we have an extensive database consisting of 70,000+ records of anime belonging to different genres.

# Project Workflow:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)<br>

2. KMeans Clustering<br>

2.1 Pre-processing and feature scaling.<br>
2.2 Finding Optimal 'k' value based on inertia.<br>
2.3 Finding Optimal 'k' value based on Silhouette Score.<br>
2.4 Profiling the clusters.<br>

3. DBSCAN Clustering<br>

3.1 Finding EPS using approxiamation.<br>
3.2 Visualize the outlier.<br>

4. Principle Component analysis(Dimensionality Reduction)<br>

5. Perform KMeans Clustering on the PCA data.<br>

6. Profile and Visualize the Clusters.<br>

7. Popularity based recommendation system.<br>

8. Content based recommendation recommendation system.<br>

9. Collaborative filtering recommendation system.<br>

10.Market basket analysis to buid association between the genres.<br>
